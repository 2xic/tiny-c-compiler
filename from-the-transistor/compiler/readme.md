From the transistor I'm supposed to td do the following
1. Write a C compiler
- I get most points of doing this :) I'll do this
3. Build a linker
- I might skip this one, started on it, but it is not fun. Not feeling it as a project and the other parts are more interesting.  
4. Implement something like libc + Malloc
- We have malloc
5. Add some IR ?
- https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/08/01/llvm-ir/ has some exampels of the llvm IR.
